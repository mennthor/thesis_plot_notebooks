"""
Cross validated Kernel Densitiy Estimation bandwidth grid search using sklearn.

The KDE is used to draw event from the BG distribution.
The scale factors are guessed to make the feature scales in each dimension
approximately equal, because we have only a symmetric and global kernel.
These scales have always to be used with the best bandwidth estimate.

Used in 3 passes with a 20-fold VC each to narrow in on the best bandwidth:
1. Coarse    : bandwidth [0.01, 3.] in 0.5 steps.     Best: 0.51
2. Finer     : bandwidth [0.01, 1.] in 0.01 steps.    Best: 0.11
3. Very Fine : bandwidth [0.10, 0.12] in 0.001 steps. Best: 0.114
